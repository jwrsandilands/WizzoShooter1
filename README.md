# Wizzo Wacky VVoid Adventure
This is a file that I have made in an attempt to complete my Soft 166 brief.
Below you can find links to the other pages of my work, as well as some info on the game.

#Game Summary
You play as Wizzo, who has recently trapped himself in the VVoid in his search for more magical power.
Luckily, he always makes sure to keep his weapons handy. You must use these powerful weapons to carve your way back out.
The VVoid is a strange place, filled with unusual objects and creatures, but you must power on through.
Perhaps Wizzo may still be able to find the magical power he is looking for from the depths of this abyss...
